## The problem:

Owing to the daily busy schedule of individuals, we often put our health aside and flow with the work or anything pertaining to it.

## Idea and concept:

Our platform GetHub allows developers to upload the source code of any small/big project and convert it into an NFT token. Users can list this as open-source and start crowdfunding with the help of wallets like MetaMask. for their efforts. Once the crowdfunding reaches the threshold amount of category it is uploaded into the NFT token will be burned. Users can also enlist their work in the marketplace as a tradable item. A tradable item can be bought in the marketplace resulting in the transfer 

## Details:
The most used technology in the ever-growing field of developers is coding technology. Computer code is an amazing tech, code can entertain, educate, inform, publish e-books, build websites, and much more. We have addressed the growing need of the developer community which is to encourage open source. Open-source is the reason that technology has developed at such a breakneck pace for the past few decades. Without it, many of the technologies we take for granted today would never have developed or would be locked away behind patent law. Many young developers see open-source as a no-revenue platform or a boring task. Our platform GetHub allows developers to upload the source code of any small/big project and convert it into an NFT token. Users can list this as open-source and start crowdfunding with the help of wallets like MetaMask. for their efforts. Once the crowdfunding reaches the threshold amount of category it is uploaded into the NFT token will be burned. Users can also enlist their work in the marketplace as a tradable item. A tradable item can be bought in the marketplace resulting in the transfer of ownership/the NFT token.GetHub is available on both the web and android. GetHub, on one hand, encourages young developers to work on open source and on the other hand help, developers sell their source code token hence combining the best of both worlds of coding
